**Face, Age, and Gender Detection using Deep Learning**



Project Overview


This project aims to detect faces in images and predict their age and gender using deep learning techniques. By utilizing pre-trained models, the project can analyze visual data to accurately detect faces and make age and gender predictions. This system can have various applications in areas such as demographic studies, personalized advertising, and security systems.

Features
Face Detection: Uses a pre-trained model to identify faces in an image.
Age Prediction: Estimates the approximate age of the person.
Gender Prediction: Predicts whether the person is male or female.
Real-time Detection: Can process images in real time from a video feed (optional, if implemented).

Getting Started

Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
OpenCV
TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib


Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash

git clone https://github.com/Ayushman-Mandhotra/BCA-Thesis.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd BCA-Thesis
Install the required Python libraries:

bash

Dataset

This project uses pre-trained models for face detection, age, and gender prediction, but you can also use your custom dataset for training. If you choose to do so, make sure the images are labeled appropriately for age and gender.

Usage
Face Detection: To detect faces in an image, run:

bash

python src/face_detection.py --image path_to_image.jpg
Age and Gender Prediction: To predict the age and gender of faces:

bash

python src/age_gender_prediction.py --image path_to_image.jpg
Real-time Detection (Optional): If you want to process a live video feed from a webcam, run:

bash

python src/age_gender_prediction.py --video 0


Models
This project relies on the following pre-trained models:

Face Detection: Utilizes OpenCV's Haar Cascades.
Age and Gender Prediction: Built on deep learning models pre-trained on large datasets.
Future Enhancements


Enhance the accuracy of age and gender prediction using more extensive datasets.
Optimize real-time detection performance.
Explore advanced deep-learning architectures for improved accuracy.
