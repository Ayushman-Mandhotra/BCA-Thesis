**Face, Age, and Gender Detection using Deep Learning**



Project Overview


This project aims to detect faces in images and predict their age and gender using deep learning techniques. By utilizing pre-trained models, the project can analyze visual data to accurately detect faces and make age and gender predictions. This system can have various applications in areas such as demographic studies, personalized advertising, and security systems.

Features
Face Detection: Uses a pre-trained model to identify faces in an image.
Age Prediction: Estimates the approximate age of the person.
Gender Prediction: Predicts whether the person is male or female.
Real-time Detection: Can process images in real-time from a video feed (optional, if implemented).

Getting Started

Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
OpenCV
TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/AyushmanMandhotra/face-age-gender-detection.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd face-age-gender-detection
Install the required Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
The project uses pre-trained models for face detection, age, and gender prediction, but you can also train the model on custom datasets if desired. If training on a custom dataset, ensure that the images are properly labeled for age and gender.

Usage
Face Detection: To detect faces in an image, run:

bash
Copy code
python src/face_detection.py --image path_to_image.jpg
Age and Gender Prediction: To predict age and gender:

bash
Copy code
python src/age_gender_prediction.py --image path_to_image.jpg
Real-time Detection (Optional): If you want to process a live video feed from a webcam, run:

bash
Copy code
python src/age_gender_prediction.py --video 0
Example


Models
The project uses the following pre-trained models:

Face Detection Model: Uses OpenCV's Haar Cascades for face detection.
Age and Gender Prediction Model: Based on deep learning models pre-trained on large datasets for age and gender classification.


Future Improvements


Enhance the accuracy of age and gender prediction models with more data.
Improve real-time performance for larger video inputs.
Explore using more advanced architectures like CNN-based models for improved prediction accuracy.
